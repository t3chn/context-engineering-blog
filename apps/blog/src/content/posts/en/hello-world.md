Hello!

This is my new blog dedicated to **context engineering** — the art of creating effective context for LLMs.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering is a systematic approach to designing context for language models. It's not just about "writing a good prompt", but a whole discipline that includes:

- **Context structure** — how to organize information
- **Token management** — efficient use of the context window
- **Tools and integrations** — connecting external data sources
- **Prompt engineering** — techniques for writing instructions

## Why is this important?

With the growth of context windows (from 4K to 200K+ tokens), the ability to properly structure context is becoming a critical skill.

Stay tuned!
