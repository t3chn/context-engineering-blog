## Ready Post Examples

### Example 1: Observation

```
Prompt engineering is marketing.
Context engineering is product.

The difference: a prompt tries to "convince" the model.
Context gives the model everything it needs to work.

The first approach is fragile.
The second — scales.

#contextengineering #llm
```

### Example 2: Practical Insight

```
Spent a day debugging a prompt.
The problem wasn't the prompt.

The model didn't know project context:
what files exist, what dependencies.

Added repository structure to context.
Prompt became 3x shorter.
Result — more stable.

#contextengineering #debugging
```

### Example 3: Hypothesis

```
Not sure large context windows are a panacea.

100K tokens sounds like a lot.
But if context is unstructured —
the model gets lost just like a human in a long document.

Hypothesis: structure matters more than volume.
Will be testing.

#contextengineering #hypothesis
```

### Example 4: Resource Link

```
Anthropic released a guide on context engineering.

Key insight: context is not a prompt.
It's an information management system for LLMs.

Includes: instructions, data, examples, constraints.
Order and structure affect the result.

### Example 5: Short Insight

```
Less prompt — better result.

Paradox: the more you explain the task,
the worse the model understands it.

Reason: noise drowns the signal.
Solution: structured context instead of long instructions.
